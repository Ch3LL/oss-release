In preparation for our upcoming _salt_version_ release, we plan to create a _salt_version_ branch on _date_ off of the develop branch of Salt. The creation of the branch will also constitute a feature freeze for the _salt_version_ release.

After the feature freeze and branch, we will only be accepting critical bug fixes into the new _salt_version_ branch. We will be doing regular merge forwards from the other active branches.

If you would like to include any features in the _salt_version_ release, please get them in before the end of the month. Make sure any features are merged into develop before _date_. We will be doing regular merge forwards into develop up to that point.

Below is the current draft of the release notes for the _salt_version_ release. Please add any new features to the below release notes.
