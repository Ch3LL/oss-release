The branch creation and feature freeze for our upcoming _salt_version_ release is now complete. If your PR was merged into develop before today or has an _salt_version_ label applied to the PR it will be included in the _salt_version_ release. We will review the PRs submitted before today again this week to ensure we did not miss any needed features for _salt_version_. We will also be making efforts this week to merge the remaining PRs with _salt_version_ labels. We are no longer accepting new features for the _salt_version_ release.

If you have a question about a particular PR submitted please email the Release Team at open-release-team@saltstack.com

Critical bug fixes for _salt_version_ should now be committed to the "_salt_version_" branch. Bug fixes that were previously submitted on the "develop" branch should be moved to the "_salt_version_" branch.

Note that we will be doing regular merge forwards from other active branches.

The _salt_version_ branch will be renamed to a version once we are closer to a release date. Because of the way our versioning system works, we did create a versioned tag (_tag_) which is subject to change but reflects our target release month.

Below is the current draft of the release notes for the _salt_version_ release. If you have any additions to the release notes please feel free to contribute.

We hope to have a public RC for testing soon. Thanks, as always, for your contributions.
