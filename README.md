Automation Scripts for OSS Releases

WARNING: This repo is *very new* and subject to change at any time.

For now, this repository serves as a place to keep scripts to start
automating the release process further. As this project grows, we
can start gluing various steps together.

**NOTE:** Most of these scripts have not been designed for wide-use.
Many of the files, if not all, depend on specific file paths and
git configurations. Please review each file and adjust it as needed
before running any file in this repo!

The files in this repo can and will be adjusted over time to allow
more general use or for a release bot of some kind (TBD). In the mean
time, this repo serves as a place to start dumping these automation
files so we can work on them together.
